#### :raising_hand: About me:
I'm a software engineer and a tech-blogger.<br>
My likes are recursions, functional programming and git hacks.<br>
My dislikes are long walks on the beach and writing bios.<br>

#### :house: Work:
I work at BigPanda :panda_face:, doing some very interesting stuff with event streaming and microservices (mainly in Scala, but also some NodeJs).<br>

#### :computer: blog:
I write a tech-blog (in hebrew) about tech, interviews and algorithms. You can find it [here](https://algoritmim.co.il/) (if you don't speak the language you can look at the pretty pictures!)
