Hey there! I’m **Maya** — a programmer with over 12 years of experience crafting software, mentoring developers, and pipelining pielines.  

I write [**Maya’s Algorithms**](https://algoritmim.co.il/), a tech blog where I share thoughts on programming, problem-solving, and the quiet joys hidden inside a well-designed algorithm.  

🌀 I’m endlessly fascinated by **recursion**, **functional programming**, and the art of writing beautiful code.  

🌱 I love **teaching and sharing knowledge**, helping others find that magical *“aha!”* moment when everything suddenly clicks into place.

🤩 These days, I’m pouring my heart into *Pagefull*, my dream **book app** that brings the reading and statistics app that would make book lovers rejoice.
